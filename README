QUEST is a determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) package designed to simulate the Hubbard model
at finite temperatures. 

Folders in the package:
	/EXAMPLE ...... Sample implementations of the QUEST library.
	/OpenBLAS ..... OpenBLAS library.
	/SRC .......... QUEST source code.
	/doc .......... Documentations.
	/geometries ... Examples of general geometry inputs.

Installation and test:
  1. Edit Makefile based on your local system settings. 
  2. Build QUEST by launching make.
  3. If QUEST is successfully built, head to /EXAMPLE/test.
     There will be two executables that can be used to test the build.

       - test1 ..... Simulate the Hubbard model on a 4x4 square lattice. 
                     No input file needed. Simply launch the executable.

       - test2 ..... Simulate the Hubbard model on an LxL square lattice.
                     There are 3 sample input files:
                        small.in ..... L = 8
                        median.in .... L = 10
                        large.in ..... L = 16
                     To run the L=8 simulation, for example, use "test2 small.in", no
                     input redirection is necessary.

   4. Once the build is verified, the executable /EXAMPLE/geom/ggeom is the most 
      general implementation of the QUEST library. Using general geometry input,
      the executable can be used to simulate any lattice geometry that can be defined
      by QUEST's convention. Examples of geometry input can be found under /geometries.

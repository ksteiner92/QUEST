# Introduction #

Code should be tested. Here is list of the tests that should be implemented.

# Global tests #
For different lattices.

  1. u = 0.
    1. comparison with analytic solution
    1. comparison with exact diagonalization.
  1. t = 0
    1. comparison with analytic solution.
    1. at t = 0 size and shape of the lattice is not important
    1. comparison with exact diagonalization.
  1. u != 0, t !=0
    1. comparison with exact diagonalization.
  1. Results for the simulation with symmetries on/off
  1. Results for the simulation with phase on/off
